# Childhood-Cancer-Mortality-Trend
A study of childhood cancer mortality rate based on CDC data from 1999 to 2015

A project from Data 601 Introduction to Data Science

The source URL for the data is

This dataset is available to the general public through the website of the Centers for Disease Control. 
Accessing this data does not violate any laws. 
This specific dataset does not appear to have been previously analyzed based on a Google search. 

A preliminary survey of the data indicates there are 792 rows (summarized from a 22301 rows of original individual data), 10 columns, and the file is 49.7 kB. 

Based on my professional training and experience in microbiology and immunology, 
I am well equipped to analyze and develop hypotheses from my results. 
Hence, I hypothesize that the mortality associated with various childhood cancer types has decreased from 1999 to 2015. This is consistent with the advances in treatment and prevention over that same period. However, I will test the data available to see if that hypothesis is true.

As a backup if I encounter problems, there are multiple datasets on the CDC portal, expressed in different formats, available to the public. In addition, I can always access MEDLINEPLUS.gov to acquire the relevant data.
